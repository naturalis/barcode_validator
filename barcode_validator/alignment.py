alignment.py

This module contains the functions for technical QA on sequence results, including operations
to align/unalign the sequence against an HMM, calculate the length of the sequence inside the
barcode marker region, and calculate the number of stop codons, which is intended as an
indication of off-target amplification of a pseudogene.
