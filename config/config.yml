# Detauls of the repository. This is where the daemon will find local files in pull requests and how it will compose
# the URLs to the various pull request service endpoints. For the endpoints we are quite intimately tied to GitHub
# and the GitHub API (e.g. in the structure of the JSON that is returned), so this is not very flexible.

# Alignment configuration. This needs the location of an HMM file for the focal marker. This is used in conjunction with
# `hmmalign` from the HMMER package to align the sequences to the HMM. The assumption is that the executable is in the
# PATH because it is installed in the conda environment as a dependency of the barcode_validator package.

# Which taxonomic level to use for the ID check. The idea is that the expected taxon (in BOLD) and the observed taxa
# (in NCBI) are at this level in the taxonomy and match exactly. So far this has worked well for the family level, and
# this should hold for higher taxa as well.
level: family

# Where to constrain the BLAST search. This indicates the higher taxon level within the NCBI taxonomy to which the
# observed taxa and the expected taxon belong and to which the search should be constrained. This is used to speed up
# the search and to avoid false positives.

# Configuration for local blast. The lower case values are used as arguments to the blastn command. The upper case
# values are used to set environment variables that are used by the blastn command. The BLASTDB environment variable
# is used to specify the location of the BLAST database. The BLASTDB_LMDB_MAP_SIZE environment variable is used to
# specify the amount of RAM allocated to the blastn job.
